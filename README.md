# imbue_the_worm

Imbue The Worm is a hobby project I am doing to
1. Teach myself the Rust programming language
2. Learn the Nannou framework

So far this renders a wiggly colourful worm who experiences gravitational acceleration towards your cursor.

If you want to run this, use rustup to get rust set up on your machine, clone this repo, and run `cargo run --release` 

It will probably crash if you resize the windowâ€¦ I think this is an open bug in Nannou.
